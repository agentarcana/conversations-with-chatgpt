A public library of my personal conversations with ChatGPT.

# What is this?

This repo contains my private conversations with ChatGPT. 

For me, this is an experiment in radical vulnerability. One of my biggest fears is being misunderstood, however, I have long been a lurker and consumer of other people's wonderful ideas, and the desire to share and "give back" in my own way has grown stronger. 

I have tried and failed to distill and "package" the evolution and insights I've gained from my interactions with ChatGPT. At first, writing a blog or making a video of the polished insights seemed the most logical, but there is no way for me to know which parts will be useful or interesting to you. So now, I'm just going to let you _see_ me learning and growing and changing during these conversations. As a spectator, you get to draw your own conclusions and make judgements on: the "meta" level of my prompting, the way ChatGPT responds, how I react to its responses (sometimes it's made me cry and I tell it), and the things that I share with it. That last part is the scariest - to not have control over who gets to see my questions and desires and feelings about the world and myself.

# Rules of engagement

On the off chance that anyone actually sees this repo, please note that I am not currently open to feedback or criticism on any of the contents. Happy lurking!
